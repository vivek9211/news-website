# news-website
This website show recent news from all over of world using google news api. It has different catagory for news fetching from api like sports, business, health, technology and many more.
Technology that I have used is: Javascript, Reactjs (functional and class components)

# api used: gnews.io
Endpoint of api is: https://gnews.io/api/v4/top-headlines
api key is: aa16f1e6aa51c18aafd125b81702be00

I have used axios method for fetching the api data into json format and stringify for final result like displaying.
